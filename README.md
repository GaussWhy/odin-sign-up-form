Sign Up Form for an Imaginary Service - The Odin Project

In this project, I created a sign up form for an imaginary service as part of The Odin Project.  This is a static webpage.  The design file I attempted to recreate is: https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/afdbabfab03fbc34783c6b6f3920aba4a4d3b935/intermediate_html_css/forms/project_sign_up_form/imgs/sign-up-form.png

The hardest part of this project was having the form inputs be directly underneath the label, instead of side-by-side.  As well, I struggled with positioning the left column Odin Logo + "Odin" word.
